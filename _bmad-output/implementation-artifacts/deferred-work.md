# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-game-data-type-extension-and-schema-definition (2026-05-20)

- `as unknown as ReturnType<...>` double-cast in `useOptimizationStream.test.ts` (lines 315, 353, 381, 417) weakens test mock type coverage. Root cause: partial mock objects for `useBuildStore` and `useGameDataStore` don't fully satisfy store return types (likely `schemaVersion: 2 as const` vs `schemaVersion: 1 | 2` union). Fix: make mocks complete or use `satisfies` with `Partial<>`. Deferred as pre-existing; address in a dedicated test-cleanup story.
